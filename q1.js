console.log(myFunction())
console.log(result)

// The code has a function called myFunction & it passes two arguments within it (num1 & num2)

// The function wants to return num1 + num2

// There's a const variable for the outcome called result.  This result has the outcome of the function and shows the values in brackets of num1 (5) & num2 (5)

// Prediction - shows the function arguments - num1, num2, then below shows 10.

// Outcome showed "Nan" & "10" - The result part was as expected.  The function doesn't show the argument names just NaN as there's no values so nothing to show.
