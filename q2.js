function myFunction(num1, num2) {
  num1+num2
}

const result = myFunction(5,5)

console.log(result)

// Prediction - The same outcome as q1

// Was wrong - said undefined... I think this was because there is no return in the myFunction unlike in q1.  Therefore the calculation of num1 + num2 has nowhere to show the outcome "="" or "return" 10

// So it is undefined as the calculation is incomplete at least to be shown in the log
