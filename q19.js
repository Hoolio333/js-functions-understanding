function myFunction(num1, num2, num3) {
  return num2
}

const result = myFunction(5, 10, 15)

console.log(result)

// I expect console.log to show 10 for the result as num2 is the return & num2 is 10 in the myFunctions() & num2 is highlighted in the function, unlike num1 & num 3 which shows it is active

// Correct 10 was shown in console.log(result)
