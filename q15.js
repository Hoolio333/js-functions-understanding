function myFunction(num1) {
  if(true) {
    return -10
  }

  return num1 * 10
}

const result = myFunction(5)

console.log(result)

// Similar to previous q - Despite myFunction num1 being stated (5).  The function calaculation just stated if the number is true (& 5 is 5 - therefore is true) the return is -10

//Therefore in the console.log I predict result to show -10

//Correct 10 was shown
