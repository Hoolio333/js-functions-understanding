function myFunction(num) {
  return num-1
}

let num = 10
num = myFunction(num)
console.log(num)
num = myFunction(num)
console.log(num)


// The code is showing a function called myFunction which has one argument within it called num.

// Inside the myFunction the calculation is showing the num - 1 and return should show this in the log.Inside

// A let variable has been assigned for num with the value of 10.

// num = myFunction(num) should mean 10 = myFunction(10 - 1) therefore I predict the log should show 9 for the first line 

// The second line num now is 9 therefore I expect num to be 8.

// In the console log I expect to see 9 then 8 after my two console.logs

// It was as I expected
