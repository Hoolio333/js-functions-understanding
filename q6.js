function myFunction(num, num1) {
    console.log(num1)
 }

let num = 10
let num1 = 2

myFunction(num1, num)

// Function similar to the last question, but different ending myFunction(num1, num)

// I predicted it to be 2, wrongly. Thought it would be linked to the variable name (num1). 

// But it seems that it doesn't matter what the name is called it looks at the order of the numbers.
